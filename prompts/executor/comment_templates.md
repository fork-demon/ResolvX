## Priority Emoji Mapping

The executor uses these emojis to indicate priority:

| Priority | Emoji | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| HIGH     | üî¥    | Urgent, requires immediate action |
| MEDIUM   | üü°    | Important, should be addressed soon |
| LOW      | üü¢    | Nice to have, can be addressed later |

---

## Status Icon Mapping

The executor uses these icons to indicate action type:

| Action Type | Icon | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Analysis    | ü§ñ   | Automated analysis complete |
| Assignment  | üéØ   | Ticket assigned to team |
| Escalation  | üö®   | Escalated to human |
| Info Request| üìã   | More information needed |
| Success     | ‚úÖ   | Action completed successfully |
| Warning     | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | Requires attention |

---

## Customization

To customize templates:

1. Edit `agents/executor/agent.py`
2. Modify the comment formatting in execution methods:
   - `_add_comment()` - Line ~245
   - `_add_comment_with_actions()` - Line ~270
   - `_assign_to_team()` - Line ~315
   - `_escalate_to_human()` - Line ~345
   - `_request_more_info()` - Line ~375

3. Or override via configuration in `config/agent.yaml`:

```yaml
executor:
  comment_templates:
    simple: "prompts/executor/simple_comment.md"
    detailed: "prompts/executor/detailed_comment.md"
    assignment: "prompts/executor/assignment_comment.md"
    escalation: "prompts/executor/escalation_comment.md"
    info_request: "prompts/executor/info_request_comment.md"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it concise**: Zendesk users skim comments
2. **Use visual indicators**: Emojis help with quick scanning
3. **Be specific**: Include actionable information
4. **Maintain consistency**: Use the same format across all tickets
5. **Include bot signature**: Makes it clear this is automated

*These are formatting templates, not LLM prompts. The Executor agent does NOT use an LLM - it only formats and posts comments based on Supervisor decisions.*
