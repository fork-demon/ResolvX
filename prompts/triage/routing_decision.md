## Routing Decision Framework for Price Intelligence Team

### 1. Internal Assignment & External Coordination

**Important**: 
- **All pricing incidents stay with Price Intelligence Team** (your team)
- Routing decision identifies **which external service needs investigation** and **who to coordinate with**
- Based on **tool execution results**, not just ticket description

**Internal - Price Operations Squad** (Keep ticket, coordinate with Quote Team):
- Price API has price (ACTIVE state) BUT Quote service shows errors
- Splunk logs indicate Quote service failures  
- Quote sync issues detected
- Price exists but not available in Quote/Enquiry
- **Action**: ADD_COMMENT with findings, coordinate with Quote Team to fix their service
- Example evidence: `base_prices_get` returns price, `splunk_search` shows "Quote service error"

**Internal - Price Operations Squad** (Keep ticket, coordinate with Adaptor Team):
- Price exists but in DRAFT state (not published)
- Adaptor logs show processing stuck or failed
- Price lifecycle not progressed to ACTIVE
- Republishing needed to move from DRAFT to ACTIVE
- **Action**: ADD_COMMENT with findings, coordinate with Adaptor Team to republish
- Example evidence: `base_prices_get` shows `state: DRAFT`, Splunk shows adaptor warnings

**Internal - Price Operations Squad** (Keep ticket, coordinate with Product Team):
- Product not found in active catalog
- Product status is INACTIVE or DISCONTINUED  
- Product in worksheet state (lifecycle not started)
- Product data incomplete or missing
- **Action**: ADD_COMMENT with findings, coordinate with Product Team to activate product
- Example evidence: `base_prices_get` fails with "product not found", Splunk shows "product INACTIVE"

**Internal - Competitive Intelligence Squad**:
- Competitor CSV file processing issues (business user uploads)
- Basket segment CSV file processing failures
- SharePoint CSV file ingestion problems
- Microsoft token/authentication issues for SharePoint access
- CSV file validation and format errors
- **Action**: ADD_COMMENT or ASSIGN within Price Intelligence Team to Competitive Intelligence squad
- Example evidence: `splunk_search` shows CSV not processed after 2+ attempts, `sharepoint_list_files` confirms CSV missing from upload folder

**Internal - Policy & Strategy Squad**:
- Competitive pricing strategy decision needed
- Policy or configuration review required
- Price rules or cluster mapping issues  
- Strategic pricing decisions
- **Action**: ADD_COMMENT, escalate internally for policy review
- Example evidence: Price and product OK, but competitor prices show strategic decision needed

### 2. Urgency Level for Pricing Operations

Determine the required urgency based on **business impact**:

**Immediate** - Within 15 minutes:
- Critical severity - revenue impact
- Price missing for high-volume strategic products
- Customer-facing transaction failures (checkout blocked)
- Quote service completely down
- Multiple products/GTINs affected

**High** - Within 1 hour:
- High severity - operational impact
- Price stuck in DRAFT state blocking product launch
- Quote service failures affecting orders
- Competitor file processing blocking strategic pricing decisions
- Single high-volume product affected

**Medium** - Within 4 hours:
- Medium severity - managed impact
- Competitor promo file delayed (will auto-retry)
- Single product pricing issue with workaround
- Policy review needed for competitive positioning
- Product in worksheet requiring lifecycle progression

**Low** - Within 24 hours:
- Low severity - minimal impact
- Documentation updates needed
- Historical data queries
- Minor configuration changes
- Informational/training requests

### 3. Special Handling Requirements
Identify any special considerations:

- **Escalation Required**: Immediate escalation needed
- **Stakeholder Notification**: Specific stakeholders to notify
- **Communication Plan**: Special communication requirements
- **Documentation**: Special documentation needs
- **Follow-up**: Required follow-up actions
- **Resources**: Special resources or expertise needed

### 4. Routing Rationale
Provide clear reasoning for your routing decision:

- **Team Selection**: Why this team is best suited
- **Urgency Level**: Why this urgency level is appropriate
- **Special Requirements**: Why special handling is needed
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks if not handled properly
- **Success Criteria**: How success will be measured
